    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I made this as a breakfast cake but it is so good that my family eats it for dessert. I baked mine in a cast iron skillet but a springform pan will also work.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ cup unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>½ cup buttermilk, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package strawberries, diced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10-inch cast iron skillet.</li>
        <li>Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Cream butter and 1 cup sugar with an electric mixer together in another bowl until light and fluffy. Add eggs, 1 at a time, mixing well after each addition. Add vanilla.</li>
        <li>Add dry ingredients and buttermilk alternately. Fold in strawberries.</li>
        <li>Transfer batter into the prepared skillet and smooth out the top. Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons sugar.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 60 to 75 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
