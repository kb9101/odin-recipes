    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>My mother gave me this to use at my mother group. Everyone loved it so I decided to post it and share the great blend of peaches and French toast. Smells great when cooking.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>Â½ cup butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>1 (29 ounce) can sliced peaches, drained</li>
        <li>12 (3/4 inch thick) slices day-old French bread</li>
        <li>5 eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground cinnamon, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>In a saucepan, stir together the brown sugar, butter and water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring frequently.</li>
        <li>Pour the brown sugar mixture into a 9x13 inch baking dish, and tilt the dish to cover the entire bottom. Place peaches in a layer over the sugar coating, then top with slices of French bread.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs and vanilla. Slowly pour over the bread slices to coat evenly. Sprinkle cinnamon over the top. Cover and refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Remove the dish from the refrigerator about 30 minutes before baking to come to room temperature. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the bread is golden brown. Spoon out portions to serve.</li>
    </ol>
